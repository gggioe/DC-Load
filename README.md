# DC-Load

Work in progress. At this point, no fully functional board has been produced. Some functional block or component has been tested with good result, since this is a hobby project there is no ETA. Software and Hardware (even this repo) will be constantly updated however i plan to release a fully functional prototype as soon as possible.

The idea behind this project is to build a precise DC load while still maintaining a relatively low BOM cost. The main goals are: Precision (hopefully 1mA), Safety (Overvoltage, overcurrent, overpower protection, internal temp monitor), Relatively high specs (180V, 40A), maybe for remote control. On the software side, the goal is to implement classical DC load functions (CV, CC, CP, CR) and maybe other functions like capacity test, programmable current ramp, etc.
